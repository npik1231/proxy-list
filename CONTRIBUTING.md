# Common Questions
### Will these links show on both `list.md` and the website?
Yes, they are automatically synced.

### What if a link I submit no longer works?
After three consecutive failed HTTP checks (runs every six hours), a link is eligible to be removed from `list.md`. The scheduled job **purges** dead rows by default once that threshold is reached (`link_status.json` tracks consecutive failures). To keep failure counts without deleting rows (for debugging), set the Actions variable `LINK_CHECK_NO_PURGE` to `true`, or run `python scripts/link_checker.py` locally with `LINK_CHECK_NO_PURGE=true`.

### When do users see update banners?
Link checks and filter metadata run every six hours **silently** (no revision bump). Users only get the refresh banner when **revision** and **Last Updated** change — on **Sundays** when the bot removes or adds links, or when a maintainer bumps **version** and `## Update Notice` for a weekly release.
